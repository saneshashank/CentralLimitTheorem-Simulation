This article explores exponential distribution and compares the same with central limit theorem.We would be using the R function rexp(n, lambda) to generate random samples of the exponential distribution. We will do 1000 simulations of sample draws of 40 distributions each.
We would explore how the mean and variance of the samples compare against the theoretical mean and variance.
